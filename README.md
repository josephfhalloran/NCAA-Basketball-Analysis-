This project analyzes NCAA basketball data to identify key factors driving team success and to experiment with predictive modeling of game outcomes.
Using player and team-level statistics across multiple seasons, we applied exploratory data analysis, statistical modeling, and machine learning techniques
to uncover insights and evaluate predictive performance.

This was a group project for Mathematical Modeling 2, and an paper and presentation were done for this course. The paper's PDF and the presentations PPT
will be included in this repo
